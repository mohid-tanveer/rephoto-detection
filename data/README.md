# Data

## Overview

Consists of 2 folders of images: authentic and re-photo. Re-photos are separated by type of screen (LCD and OLED) as well as by the source of the re-photo (AI and authentic).

## Exif Metadata

The `exif_metadata.csv` file is a CSV file that contains the metadata for all the images in the dataset. It is generated by the `build_exif_csv.py` script builds the metadata from the images.

```bash
python build_exif_csv.py
```

The script will output the `exif_metadata.csv` file to the `data` folder.
